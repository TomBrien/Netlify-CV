career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I gained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Philip Mauskopf studying
      the cold-electron bolometer, studying its potential as an ultra-fast and
      sensitive detector for millimetre-wave astronomy. Since then I have held
      post doctroal positions with Prof. Peter Ade developing a testbed for
      next-genration mercury cadmium telluride detectors (this testbed designed
      has since been adopted by the Eurpean Space Agency) and Dr Simon Doyle
      developing kinetic-inductance detectors and cryogenics for millimetre-wave
      astronomy.


education:
    - degree: PhD - Astronomical Instrumentation
      university: Cardiff University
      time: 2011 - 2015
      details: |
        Developing ultra-fast and -sensitive detectors for millimetre wave
        astronomy. Utilising weak electorn-phonon coupling and non-Ohmic
        tunnelling contacts.

    - degree: MPhys
      university: Cardiff University
      time: 2006 - 2010
      details: |
        Inlcuding research projects studying: micro/solid-state refrigeration
        and cold-electorn boloemters.

experiences:
    - role: Cryogenic & Integration Lead
      time: 2017 - Present
      company: Mexico-UK Sub-mm Camera for Astronomy (MUSCAT)
      details: |
        Developed novel He3-light cooling system providing continous cooling
        of a 100-mK detector stage using a total of less the 10 L<sub>STP</sub>
        of helium-3. MUSCAT represents the first on-sky demonstration of passively
        switch soprtion refrigerators and miniature dilution refrigeration.

    - role: Testbed Development & Commissioning Lead
      time: 2015 - 2017
      company: "ESA TRP: Development of Low Dark Current
      MWIR/LWIR Detectors"
      details: |
        Developed a multi-banded cryogenic testbed for the study of a ultra-low
        dark current MCT detectors for astronomical applications in exoplanet
        science. The design concept of this testbed has since been reproduced
        and apoted by the European Space Agency.
