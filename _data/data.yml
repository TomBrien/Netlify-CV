career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I gained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Philip Mauskopf studying
      the cold-electron bolometer, studying its potential as an ultra-fast and
      sensitive detector for millimetre-wave astronomy. Since then I have held
      post doctroal positions with Prof. Peter Ade developing a testbed for
      next-genration mercury cadmium telluride detectors (this testbed designed
      has since been adopted by the Eurpean Space Agency) and Dr Simon Doyle
      developing kinetic-inductance detectors and cryogenics for millimetre-wave
      astronomy.
